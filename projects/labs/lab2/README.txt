Lab 2

  Part1:
    For my HTML markup I chose to include a series of <ul> elements in my body.
    Each <ul> element represents the title bar and each of the 6 songs. Each of
    the <li> items in the list represent the different attributes of each song
    such as artist, album, etc. I believed that the this was a very straightforward
    and concise way to organize the data.
    I also made sure to set a class for the <ul> elements and each of the
    different <li> elements. In addition, I set a unique ID for the <ul> element
    that represents the title bar. This is a good start for me to easily apply
    simple CSS declarations to the various elements. For the simple styles that
    I applied, I used a <style> section in the header.

  Part 2:
    For my XML markup I chose a simple format of creating an element for each song
    and within that element, adding more elements for each attribute of the song.
    I named these elements in the same way that I named the classes for each <li>
    element in my HMTL document.

  Part 3:
    For this part, I kept most of my HTML unchanged. I added <p> tags around the
    text within each of the <li> elements in each list to make styling a little
    easier. I also added another list item at the end for the "end of list"
    requirement.
    For my new CSS file, I formatted the HTML so that each <li> item is floated
    to the left of each <ul> which allows for the list to appear like a table
    with rows and columns. I made sure to set the width for each one to be the
    same and also as a percentage so the table could resize well with the window.
    I added some margin and height declarations to help further. Lastly, I added
    some colors to help add some contrast between the different elements of the
    table and the background of the page.

  Part 4:
    For this part I simply added the xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    phrase to my root element and added the necessary HTML tags to include the
    album hyperlinks and images.
    Then I added some simple CSS in the required format. Each song is displayed
    under the next with the attributes directly underneath, unlike part 3 which
    were horizontally inline.
