Part 1 + 3:
	The link to my lab7 repo on GitHub is: 
		https://github.com/ryanjflynn/websys
			(public)

Part 2:
	I added a bootstrap sidebar menu throughout the pages of my websys page. 
	I edited the html files and (and accompanying js files if necessary) to add the menu to each of the project pages.
	The link to the bootstrap theme that I used for this can be found at:
		https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-simple-sidebar/blob/master/index.html
	Lab links to labs that have not been completed yet (9+10) link directly back to the index.
