Assignment 1

Questions:
  1.) I selected the HTML5 doctype because it is a popular/current version and I am
  most used to it from prior labs and assignments.

  2.) This doctype compares to the other common doctypes because it is typically
  less strict in different attributes of element formatting compared to a doctype
  such as XHTML. It is also host to some newer features and still under development.

  3.) The markup of my document is semantically correct because it outlines very
  basic elements for the text I am trying to convey in the resume. I limited the
  elements mainly to <ul>, <li>, and <p> tags. These helped me to best portray
  the cascading nature of the resume and keep the text in a list-type format.
  Additionally, I included <a> and <img> tags to markup hyperlinks and my profile
  image. For all of these tags, I included class and id names to help me make
  style declarations in my CSS.
  I did not use <div> elements, but I used <span> elements in the beginning of
  the document for the purpose of adding the hCard microformat properly to the
  contact information without disrupting the styling.

  4.) The hCard information is useful to humans because it does not alter the
  text that I wanted to convey and it makes clear what aspects of my contact
  information that I want labeled. It is also useful automated user agents because
  it adds more semantic information to the text that can be read processed easily
  without context of the whole document.
